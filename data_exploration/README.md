As part of the project, the team explored a number of data sources

# population density

As part of the project we considered providing a hyper local assessment of risk based on population
denisty estimates.  A suitable 1km resolution dataset was available from the NERC Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology

Reis, S.; Liska, T.; Steinle, S.; Carnell, E.; Leaver, D.; Roberts, E.; Vieno, M.; Beck, R.; Dragosits, U. (2017). <b>UK gridded population 2011 based on Census 2011 and Land Cover Map 2015</b> NERC Environmental Information Data Centre. https://doi.org/10.5285/0995e94d-6d42-40c1-8ed4-5090d82471e1
          
The data was downloaded from https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/0995e94d-6d42-40c1-8ed4-5090d82471e1

The data was converted to .geojson files (polygonized) using qgis and displayed on interactive maps for the Bedford area using visigoth.
